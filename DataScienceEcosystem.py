# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in python

# In[9]:


(3*4)+5

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers


# In[11]:


total = 200
m= 60

total // h

# This will convert 200 hundred minutes into hours by dividing by 60


# **Objectives**
# 
# - Identify common libraries used by data scientist
# - Indentify common languages used by data scientist
# - evaluating arithmetic expressions
